# CypherGuard
This repository contains a first version of a **G**rammar-**U**tilized **A**dvisor of **R**elationship **D**irections (GUARD) for Cypher queries. 
The utility function here can be used together with LLM-generated Cypher, as a post-processing step to correct queries.

Key advantages of a schema + grammar approach are:
- Fast: it takes <5 milliseconds to correct relationship directions in a query.
- Deterministic: a grammar-based approach produces the same output every time.
- Simple: ~300 lines of Python code (excluding autogenerated antlr4 files)

The code here was created for the [Cypher direction validation competition](https://github.com/tomasonjo/cypher-direction-competition/tree/main).


## Folder Structure

```
/src/guard/            | Root folder for the 'library'.
/src/guard/generated/  | Auto-generated parser/lexer based on Cypher Antlr4 Grammar.
/data/                 | Training data.
example.py             | A minimal example on how to use the library.
evaluate.py            | Simple examples on how to use the app.
```

## Setup & Run
This code was tested with Python 3.10.8. To install dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the basic example:
```
python3 src/example.py 
```

To validate a set of queries from a CSV file:
```
python3 src/evaluate.py
````
(This should successfully correct 74/74 queries specified in `examples.csv`)
